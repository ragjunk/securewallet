# securewallet

This project demonstrates using Shamir's Secret Sharing to encrypt seed phrases of a wallet
for secure storage anywhere for convenient retrieval later. A "m of N" secret
is used to restore encrypted wallet data.

This repo is used to describe the proof-of-concept. The associated code is not
intended to be used in production. The motivation for this project is discussed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xstHF7hfdSWlj7rIBmAc45TpOW068caE6w3hWqSOslA/edit?usp=sharing).
